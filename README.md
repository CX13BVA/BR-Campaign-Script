# BR-Campaign-Script

This is where I'm learning to script Missions for a game called Blitzkrieg.
Hopefully I manage to learn my way and complete many scripts without too much struggle.

You can find my finished maps here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15L_aPlY0l-Ipnbocaa7ePJ8IizCREL5x?usp=sharing
Open the .pak file with 7z or winrar, instructions on "where to put what" are inside ("Read me.txt")
Feedback is always welcome, either here (on GitHub), on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eaXRcRxXsj) or on the [Blitzsrbija forum](https://blitzsrbija.proboards.com/user/2445)

## Thanks a lot to:
