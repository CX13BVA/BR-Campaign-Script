# BR-Campaign-Script

This is where I'm learning to script Missions for a game called Blitzkrieg. <br>
Hopefully I manage to learn my way and complete many scripts without too much struggle.<br>

You can find my finished maps [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15L_aPlY0l-Ipnbocaa7ePJ8IizCREL5x?usp=sharing) (Google Drive). <br>
Open the .pak file with 7z or winrar, instructions on "where to put what" are inside ("Read me.txt"). <br>
Feedback is always welcome, either here (oGitHub), on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eaXRcRxXsj) or on the [Blitzsrbija forum](https://blitzsrbija.proboards.com/user/2445).<br>

## Thanks a lot to:
- **Stanenberg**, for helping me out and showing me the right path and a usefull guide to work with.
